## GeckoLib Example Mod - Multiloader - 1.20.4

This is an example of a mod using <a href="https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib">GeckoLib</a> for <a href="https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template">Multiloader</a> 1.20.4

This template is created on the following basis:
1. Start with a clean Multiloader MDK
2. Update platform versions to be the current latest
3. Trim the template down to the bare minimum required to run (for ease of use)
4. Implement GeckoLib example objects

The ideology behind this is that it should be as close as practical to a default mod for best real-world conditions, but still be cleaned up enough for educational use

### NOTE
This mod is <u>NOT</u> intended for real-world use. This mod is only for testing and exemplifying GeckoLib use cases
